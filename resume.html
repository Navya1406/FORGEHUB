            Creating a resume  Step-by-step tutorial
            </h2>
    </div>
</div>
</div>
      
  <h5>
    STEP 1. Choose the right resume format for you
</h5>
    There are three types of resumes. Depending on your professional experience and the industry you are applying to, one of them will be the best for you.Are you applying for multiple positions in various companies or industries? You can consider more than one resume format.
</p>
<h6>
    .Chronological Format
</h6>
<p>
    A traditional format that shows your education and experience according to the order (chronological or reverse) in which they occurred. We recommend such a resume when applying to more conservative, conservative companies and industries
</p>
<h6>
    .Functional Format
</h6>
<p>
    A characteristic feature of this type of resume is listing your experience, not by time and skill. Use it if you are changing your career direction or do not have professional experience in the industry you are applying for. By demonstrating your skills, you will emphasize that you will find yourself in this position. Your work experience will then not be a problem.
</p>
<h6>
   .Combination Format
</h6>
<p>
    As the name suggests, it's a combination of selected, best aspects of a chronological and functional resume. It is not easy to create such a format, but its proper use can give excellent results. We recommend it for applications for a position that requires documenting experience in many areas. If you choose this format, be careful that your document does not become too long.
</p>
<h6>
    What will you gain, creating your CV as a website?
</h6>
<p>
    .Privacy - You may think that by creating a resume in the form of a website, anyone connected to the network will gain access to it. Relax, you don't need to be afraid of that. All you have to do is set your website as unlisted (not showing up in search results). Then only people who have a unique URL of your website will gain access to your CV.
    </p>
    <p>
 .Modernity - if you apply for a position in one of the modern industries, such as IT, creating a CV in the form of a website is a great idea. This is one of the most modern trends when it comes to employer branding and recruitment processes. By creating them, you will show that you are up-to-date with trends in your industry and that you are constantly developing.
</p>
<p>
    .Ease of editing - As you develop and gain experience, your resume will constantly change. Each new project you pursue, or a course you take part in, may prove to be of value to a potential employer. Therefore, it is important that you can easily edit and expand your résumé . A website built without any programming knowledge is ideal for this - in the website creator.
</p>
<p>
    .Unlimited design - It is only up to you what shape and appearance you will give your CV , built in the form of a website. You can use one of the unique templates in which you only put your data and photo. Or you can build a website from scratch (thanks to website builders, you can do it without writing a single line of code!). One thing is for sure - no other solution will provide you with such individuality as a website with a resume!
</p>
<h5>
    STEP 2. Create a header
</h5>
<p>
    You should include the essential information in the header. What exactly should be in it:
    1.Full name
    2.Phone number
    3.Email address
    Remember: Do not enter the address. It is redundant. In the end, you will most likely send your CV to the email address provided in the recruitment advertisement.
</p>
<h5>
    STEP 3. Write a summary
</h5>
<p>
    A few sentences (we recommend 1-3) summarize your professional experience and skills attractive to the employer. Keep it precise and specific. Remember: The summary can help you explain why you're applying for a role that is a departure from your current career path.
     Are there situations when it is not necessary to attach a summary? Yes! If your experience speaks for itself, a summary will not be necessary. In some less specialized professions, such as waiter, this is also not required.
</p>
<h5>
    STEP 4. List your experiences or skills
</h5>
<p>Remember that the "Skills" section is the place in your résumé where you should show your individual, unique strengths. So start by naming each skill specifically. Then, in two or three lines, explain how you acquired the skill or why you think you have it. Remember to write short and concisely.
    Consider what employees (with what skills) the employer is looking for. Then write down the skills you have that are most attractive to him.
    Don't forget to list the computer programs you have had experience with. However, you do not need to mention, for example, your knowledge of Microsoft Word (it is like boasting that you use cutlery when eating).</p>
    <h5>
        STEP 5. List your education
    </h5>
    <p>
        Make a list of the educational institutions you attended. Start with the most recent. If you are starting your professional career or have not graduated from university, provide information about the completed High School.Add any other educational experiences, such as training programs, community college or summer courses, seminars, and so on.
    </p>
    <h5>
        STEP 6. Don't forget to list your activities and awards
    </h5>
    <h5>
        Activities
    </h5>
    <p>
       
List both professional and additional activities in which you actively participated or organized. Describe what your roles were in each of them. Emphasize the importance of your work.
Here you can note things like memberships or leadership positions in clubs, associations, foundations, and organizations of all kinds - including sports teams, volunteering, etc. If you had an interesting job unrelated to your work field - for example, helping the disabled or tutoring - add it here. Employers are always looking for active people who are involved in their professional life. Moreover, such classes are perfect evidence of your values.
    </p>
<h5>
Awards
</h5>
<p>
List Any Awards You've Won And When You Won Them.
If you have won prizes in exciting competitions or have been appreciated similarly - inform your employer about it. Haven't received any significant awards? Don't worry. It's not a big deal. Just skip this section.
</p>
<h5>
STEP 7. Tell about yourself and list your personal interests
</h5>
<p>Describe your interests in such a way as to show that you are a versatile person that people would like to meet and work with.
Don't lie about your interests! Employers love to use this section at the start of an interview - as the icebreaker. If it then turns out that you don't know anything about your "interests," you won't get a job. Nobody wants to hire liars.
Don't mention the trivialities you like to do. Activities such as sleeping, watching TV, or playing computer games are better not included in your resume. Instead, write about your developing hobbies that you are passionate about.
Many people skip this stage of their CV. It's a mistake! After all, it's a straightforward way to stand out from other candidates and present yourself as an intere
